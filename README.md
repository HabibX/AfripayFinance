# Afripay Finance â€“ Stellar Anchor-in-a-Box API Integration

![AF frontpage](./assets/mockups/afcollection/1.png)


## **Overview**  
**Afripay Finance** provides cross-border payment solutions for underserved regions, starting with Cameroon. Our APIs leverage Stellar's blockchain infrastructure and the Anchor-in-a-Box framework to facilitate secure and fast international payments. And to do this, Afripay Finance relies on two platforms, one of which is a wallet that allows users unfamiliar with the world of cryptocurrencies to carry out their transactions securely, and another for users already invested in cryptocurrencies. However, it is important to note that the heart of all transactions (deposit, withdrawal, sending and currency exchange) remains the Stellar network for both platforms.

- **Deposits** and **withdrawals** using SEP-24.
- **Authentication** with SEP-10.
- **KYC and Compliance** with SEP-12.
